    "In this cohort analysis, I measured the retention rate of group of resellers who place at least 9 order in their first month of activation and place 9+ orders in the subsequent weeks. As a reseller makes an order in week n, she is considered as retained for week n, week n+1, week n+2, and week n+3. For this report, day 0 is the day in which resellers make their 9th order. So, here is my approach to create this report;\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find resellers with 9+ orders in their first month.\n",
    "2. Among resellers from the previous step, find those who place 9+ orders in the subsequent weeks.\n",
    "3. For week n, retention = number of resellers with 9+ orders in [week n-3, week n] interval.\n",
    "4. Divide the retention by the number of resellers with 9+ orders in week 1."
